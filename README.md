MusicXmlSharp
=============

I took the MusicXML XSD files and ran them through xsd.exe. I'm going to be using this for a couple different projects in the future, so this repo is going to act as a place to fork from; I'm not doing any real development here. Feel free to fork it yourself! If you want to help improve it, by all means feel free to tackle the 25,000 generated lines, I'm not going to stop you.
